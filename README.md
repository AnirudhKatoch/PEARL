# ⚡ PEARL

PEARL is an open-source Python framework for electro–thermal lifetime assessment of power-electronic converters.
It integrates electrical loss calculation, dynamic thermal RC-network simulation, and physics-based fatigue modeling 
into a unified workflow, enabling accurate reliability estimation under realistic mission profiles. Designed for
research and system-level analysis, PEARL captures the coupled behaviour of electrical loading, thermal cycling, and 
degradation mechanisms that govern wear-out in modern power-converter hardware. The framework provides a reproducible, 
extensible environment for studying lifetime impacts of grid services, reactive-power operation, control strategies,
and device-level design decisions, helping bridge the gap between practical converter operation and rigorous 
reliability evaluation.
